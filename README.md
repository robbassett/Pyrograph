A Plotly Dash App inspired by the classic drawing toy Spirograph. 

Currently this app his hosted on Heroku at https://pyrograph.herokuapp.com/

Can also be run stand-alone by cloning this repo locally, opening app.py in your favourite text editor, and editing the two lines in the main loop at the bottom. Simply uncomment the second to last line and comment out the last line. You can then run the app as "python app.py". This will prompt you to visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your browser where you will find the local version of the app. Note that running locally will provide significant performance improvement over the heroku hosted version.
